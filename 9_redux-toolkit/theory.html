<!-- Redux(Depreciated) || Redux-Toolkit(RTK) -->

<!-- Terminology -->

<!-- Action -> Action is nothing but events only. (Action is going to wrap my events, sometimes it wraps some additional information as well along with the event (payloads).) -->
<!-- Reducer -> Reducer is another name of function. -->
<!-- Slice -> The logic to maintain the state of each and every feature is being written inside of a slice and also keeps the initial value.-->
<!-- Store -> single source of truth where we keep all the data/state -->
<!-- State -> Nothing but another name of data -->
<!-- useSelector -->
<!-- useDispatch -->

<!-- The moment I click the button, onClick will be triggered -->
<!-- onClick is going to look for the function (handlerIncrease) -->
<!-- Inside of this handlerIncrease function, we will be dispatching an action. -->
<!-- This action is going to go to the store -->
<!-- Store is going to pick the reducer function which is correspondant to the action. -->
<!-- Inside of my reducer function, I have some logic written, which will be executed -->
<!-- Those logic will be changing my state -->
<!-- We will be making the changes on the Front-End -->
